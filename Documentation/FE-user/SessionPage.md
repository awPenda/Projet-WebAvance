# SessionPage Component

The `SessionPage` component represents a page that displays session details and options for a specific session.

## Usage

To use the `SessionPage` component, import it into your React application and include it in your JSX code.

```jsx
import SessionPage from './SessionPage';

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <SessionPage />
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Dependencies

The `SessionPage` component relies on the following dependencies:

- React: The React library for building user interfaces.
- react-router-dom: The React Router library for handling routing in the application.

Make sure to have React and react-router-dom installed in your project before using the `SessionPage` component.

## Functionality

The `SessionPage` component includes the following functionality:

- It retrieves session data based on the session ID parameter from the URL using the `useParams` hook from `react-router-dom`.
- The `getSession` function is used to simulate retrieving session data. You should replace it with your actual implementation to fetch the session data from your backend or any other data source.
- The session data includes information such as the session's start and end time, title, URL, description, status, priority, tutors, and student.
- It displays the tutor's ID and a message indicating that you are on a session with that tutor.
- It includes an "Edit session" button that redirects the user to the booking page for the same session.
- It provides links to external resources related to the Teams API and Zoom for further integration.

Note: The code provided assumes the existence of a session with the specified ID and associated data. Make sure to adjust the `getSession` function and session data to match your specific implementation and data structure.

Remember to adjust the code and add necessary styling to fit your project's requirements and design.
